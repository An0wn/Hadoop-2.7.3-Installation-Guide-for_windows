# Hadoop-2.7.3-Installation-Guide-for_windows

This is a refernce to an article on medium (https://medium.com/@shwetabh.dixit/hadoop-installation-on-windows-bf699ce088ab ) providing resources for people who don't want to install maven and protocolbuffer to build a Hadoop package for Hadoop.

The simpler way is to copy download the bin file present in this repository and replace it with the bin file in your HADOOP_HOME i.e. , the directory/folder where the un-tarred version of Hadoop is present.

Also, this provides a detailed explanation of how Hadoop is configured, i.e. what is meant by the properties that are added to -
- core-site.xml
- hdfs-site.xml
- mapred-site.xml
- hadoop-env.cmd
- yarn-site.xml
